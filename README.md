## How to contribute?

This project is open source and we welcome contributions.

This project is made of two separate parts:

- The [app](./packages/app/) is a Svelte IDE that runs in the browser.
- The [lessons](./packages/lessons/) contains all the tutorials.

A lesson is a regular npm package that contains at least a `package.json` file and a `README.svx` file.

```bash
# Clone the repository
